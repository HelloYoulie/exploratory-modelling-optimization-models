The code provided on this GitHub page is related to the Delft University of Technology master thesis project as published at: 

http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:84cd083a-8bf8-4931-a75a-276e2d54c5cc

The code can be used to execute an exploratory modelling approach to provide insight into the impact of uncertainties on 
Design Optimization Models. 

Run in the following order: 
Load_data.py
PreAnalysisProcessing.py
CounterShare.py
PetaJoules.py
OutcomesofInterest.py
--> Now the results analysis steps can be performed. 

for Cosine Distance-based clustering, run in the following order after OutcomesofInterest.py: 
CosDistHeatmap.py
Clustering.py
CART.py
